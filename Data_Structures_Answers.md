Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method? `O(1)` using index to access data, data size does not matter

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function? `O(1)`

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method? `O(n)` number of iterations dependent on size of data

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method? `O(1)`

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? `O(n^2)` because of the nested for loop

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? `O(n)`

7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? `O(n)`

8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? `O(1)`
